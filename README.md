# Pizza React

Countries is a comprehensive React application built using styled-components for styling and react-router-dom for navigation. It enables users to explore information about various countries by interacting with data from the REST Countries API (restcountries.com). The application allows users to search for countries by name, filter them by region, and view detailed information about each country, such as flags, capital, population, and more.

## Features

- Filter pizzas by categories such as meat and others.
- Sort pizzas based on price, popularity, or alphabetically.
- Pagination to navigate through the list of pizzas efficiently.
